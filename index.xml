These are some of my favorites. Each one provides a clear and concise explanation of its chosen subject in a way that is imminently readable. In most cases they are so easy to read that I have sat down and read them cover-to-cover. In other cases, they are so comprehensive that I keep them within arm&amp;rsquo;s reach to serve as a chosen reference for a given subject.</description></item></channel></rss>
