In mathematics, a \"set\" is basically just a collection of stuff. Sets can be either ordered or unordered. A \"subset\" is a set containing elements from another set.

## What is a set?

A "set" is just a collection of mathematical elements. Say we have some set $A$, then to indicate that some element $x$ is "in" $A$, we would write $x \in A$.

There are few restrictions on what comprises a set. Sets can be "infinite" (in the sense that they contain an infinite number of elements) or "finite" (obviously the contrary). They can be "ordered" or "unordered." They can also be comprised of numbers, sets, functions, or whatever else you want.

## What is a subset?

A "subset" $A$ is a special kind of set for which every element in $A$ also exists in some other set $B$ called a "superset." If $A$ is a "strict" subset, that specifically indicates $A$ excludes at least one element of the superset $B$.

Formally speaking, if $A$ is a subset of $B$, then we would write $A \subseteq B$. If it was a strict subset, then we would write $A \subset B$.

## What is a union?

A "union" is a special kind of set which contains every element from two other sets. It is equivalent to a logical OR in the sense that if some element $x \in A$ or $x \in B$, then $x$ is also in the union of $A$ and $B$.

Formally speaking, the union of $A$ and $B$ is written $A \cup B$.

## What is an intersection?

An "intersection" is a set which contains only elements which appear in two other sets.

Formally speaking, if $x$ is some element such that $x \in A$ and $x \in B$, then $x \in A \cap B$.
