Iâ€™ve discovered that a truly great textbook about a higher-level subject can often be difficult to find. These are some of my favorites. Each one provides a clear and concise explanation of its chosen subject in a way that is imminently readable. In most cases they are so easy to read that I have sat down and read them cover-to-cover. In other cases, they are so comprehensive that I keep them within arm's reach to serve as a chosen reference for a given subject.

Obviously, this list will never be complete. I'm simply adding titles as I work back through different subjects from my undergraduate studies. If you're interested in applications of math, however, most of these are a great introduction to a particular subject.
